# KeyMapper
## A keyboard shortcut mapping tool

### What's this?

Knew you'd ask. So, you ever find yourself struggling to find a comfortable keyboard shortcut for that one feature they didn't bother to map? I have. So I wrote KeyMapper. It does things! More specifically, one thing.

#### Thing it does

* Shows you which keyboard shortcut you're currently pressing

### Oh wow.

Yeah! Check out the [live demo](teetow.com/keymapper)!

### Why, though?

I mean, mostly because I felt like building it, the CSS for drawing the keyboard is kinda neat.

### Fair enough. What can I do with it?

Right now, you just play around with it. Here's what I want to build, though:

#### Things it should do

* Map shortcut to an action
* Tells you which keys already have actions
* Lists all the actions you've already mapped
* Import and export lists of actions

### Import from where? To where?

Honestly, no idea. Kind of a future-me problem. I'd love to let this read and write, say, Blender shortcuts but I wouldn't hold my breath. PR:s welcome, though!

### I see. Well, nice talking to ya.

Likewise!

### Who are you, again?

I'm Johan. I write code and make [bouncy music](www.soundcloud.com/teetow).
